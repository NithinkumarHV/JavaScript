SYNTAX PARSER
    Translates your code to machine understandable instructions

LEXICAL ENVIRONMENT
    With respect to syntaxes and grammar

EXECUTION CONTEXT
    helps to manage which code is currently running
    section of code which is running

OBJECT
    collection of name-value pairs

Global execution context has: 
    "global object(window object)" and a special variable called "this"
    In JS global means "not inside a function"
    Every window has it's own global object 
    when JS code is executed an execution context is created
    At the base level we have "window"(global) object
    Execution context is a wrapper which we didn't write and JS engine does create for us

Hoisting
